# Project Title: NYC Airbnb Project

This is my first project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. This project was designed to demonstrate my data preparation, analysis, and visualization skills using Google Sheets.

### Project Description 
Airbnb is an app based company designed to help users acquire or rent short-term or long-term housing. In this project, we are tasked with helping a client determine which property type to invest in by analyzing the Manhattan vacation rental market using Airbnb data. This project demonstates data cleaning, organization, and documentation techniques. It also showcases use of advanced formulas, conditional formatting, filters, and visualizations. The project required us to answer 1) Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals? 2) How much money did these listings generate?

### Data
The data was received from the TripleTen learning platform and copied to my Google Sheets app. It contained three different sheets in one file (Listings, Calendar, & Data Dictionary).
- Data Dictionary - This sheet defined each column and row for both the Calendar and Listings sheets. 
- Calendar - This sheet contained 7 columns and 70K+ rows of sales data for each day a listing was booked. Limited to September and part of October for the 2022 calendar year. 
- Listings - This sheet contained 69 columns and 2000+ rows of data describing the various listings in the Manhattan neighborhood on the Airbnb app.

### Process
First, I reviewed the data by cross referencing the data dictionary with the calendar and listings sheets in order to ensure my understand of the data. Next, I created a change log sheet in my data to track my process. I then duplicated the original data, so that I could clean and manipulate it. I locked the original data to prevent errors. Finally, I began answering the questions by using pivot tables, formulas, and visuals. 

### Findings
•	Neighborhoods with one-bedroom properties are our most popular property size. 

•	Harlem, the Lower East Side, and Hells Kitchen are the most popular neighborhoods. These neighborhoods also have the most one-bedroom properties. 

•	The highest earning neighborhoods with one-bedroom properties and reviews within the last 12 months are not the same as our most popular neighborhoods. Instead, they are the West Village, Chelsea, and Midtown.

•	Further research is needed to determine housing cost and expenses in our top neighborhoods vs highest earning neighborhoods. We will need this information to accurately describe the income earning potential of a listing.


### Reflection
I have a solid history using Excel/ Google Sheets in the workplace. My key takeaway from this project involved data organization, documentation, and presentation. This was a huge data set with multiple columns and rows, so taking the time to document each data preparation step was paramount. It was also critical to lock certain sheets containing raw data to prevent errors and check work. Lastly, creating a table of contents that linked each sheet to a title allowed me to stay organized and it makes the workbook look professional. 

### Reviewer’s Comments
Hello, Nathan. I glad to see you again =)

Тhank you for your excellent work, it's almost perfect. Your Excel is easy to read, you brilliantly added calculations and precisely answered all the questions. You did an excellent job in this project! Excel can be tedious, but it is a powerful tool. There are no issues that need to be fixed, so I can accept the project now. Awesome job Thank you for your work and I wish you success in your next projects!) 😊
