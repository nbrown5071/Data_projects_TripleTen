# Project Title: Zomato Customer Analysis & Marketing Proposal

This is my final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. This project was designed to demonstrate my analysis and visualization skills. I used Zomato demographic customer data and order history data to identify marketing segments in order to increase declining sales.
