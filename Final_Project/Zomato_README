# File Title: Zomato_Customer_Analysis_&_Marketing_Proposal

This is my final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. This project was designed to demonstrate my analysis and visualization skills. I used Zomato demographic customer data and order history data to identify marketing segments in order to increase declining sales.

### Data
The data was in a zip folder called Zomato Data provided by TripleTen which contained 5 Excel files. The following are the two I used in my analysis:
- `'users.xls'`: Excel workbook with identifying (name, user id, email address) and demographic (age, monthly income, education level) information about Zomato's customers.
- `'orders.xls'`: Excel workbook with order information including order date, sales quantity and amount, currency, and user id.

### Description:
- 5 page Tableau workbook. Includes 4 visualizations and one dashboard.
- 7 page .pdf report including my findings and recommendations.
- 2 page .pdf project decomposition.

### Process:
First I created the decomposition to propose my course of analysis for the project.
After the decomposition was approved, I reviewed and cleaned the data.
I created a relation between the users and orders Excel sheets in Tableau.
I created visualizations to show the relationships between the sum of sales and different customer characteristics.
I created a dashboard to summarize my findings.
Lastly, I wrote my report with my findings and recommendations for the client.

### Findings:
1. The age range that generates the highest total order amounts is customers in their 20s.			
2. Men generate the highest total order amounts. 	
3. Student is the occupation of customers who generate the highest total order amounts.
4. The monthly income for our highest total order amount generating customers is none.
5. Customers with graduate level or above education generate the highest total order amounts.

### Reviewer’s Comments:
“Hey Jillian! Thanks for the decomposition, looks very good. I enjoyed seeing the layout of the dashboard too. Can't wait to see the final project! Good luck”
